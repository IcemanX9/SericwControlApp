Hi Willie,

Quick note to say there is a new version of the app. Unfortunately my auto-update code is buggy, so the guys need to install manually.

1. Uninstall current app completely
2. In chrome, open http://www.servicecontrol.co.za/mobile/ServiceControlMobile.apk
3. Install
4. Enter auth key as always 4kf3fmp84n5w
5. Let it all sync up

Now can download client site plans.

Let's chat sometime this week.
Cheers
